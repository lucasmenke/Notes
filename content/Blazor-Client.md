# Blazor WebAssembly (Client Side)

- code is renderd by the client
- client downloads all code (including C# code)
- can't put secure stuff in this kind of project (f.e. appsettings.json)
- offline excess (local / session storage)
- can be used as an application on the device like a program that can be installed
- needs to have something like an [API](https://github.com/lucasmenke/notes/blob/main/content/API.md) to communicate to a server
