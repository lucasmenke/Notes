# Blazor Server (Server Side)

- code gets renderd on the server side
- client side is connected to a server in a way where only the changes will be recived by the server (small exchange of information not whole html, css & js code)
- for the user it appears the same way as they were using client side rendering
- downside is that it needs a connection
