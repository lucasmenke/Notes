# Web Assembly (WASM)

- allows running high level programming languages (f.e. C#, C++, Go, Python) on the browser
- .wat (web assembly text) is a low level language similar to assembly which is converted to binary format (.wasm) and runs on all modern browsers
	- reduces loss of performance compared to JIT (just in time) compiled code (JS) because code gets precompiled
