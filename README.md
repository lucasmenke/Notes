- I use GitHub / Obsidian as my notebook
- in the MOC (Map of Content) file you can find a overview of all topics
- in the content folder I have notes for programming related topics
- in the project folder I have notes for some of my projects
- feel free to browse my notes :)
- I would appreciate it if you correct me when you see some wrong information
