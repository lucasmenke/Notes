# JWT

Web tokens are data structures that contain information about a user or client in the form of digitally signed claims. They are typically used to authenticate users and provide access to certain resources or applications on a website or web service. Web tokens are often used in combination with other security measures, such as password authentication or two-factor authentication, to provide a more secure means of accessing online resources.
