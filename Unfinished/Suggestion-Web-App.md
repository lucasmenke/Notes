## Tech Stack

 - Blazor Server (.NET 6)
 - MongoDB (including Atlas)
 - Azure Active Directors B2C

<br>

## Key Thoughts

- Blazor Server 
	- gives the user a dynamic fealing like real client-sided applications
	- no need for an api to cummincate with a db
- Scalability / Efficency
	- aiming for a spot in the middle between mvp & can handle thousands of people at the same time
