# Sessions vs Tokens

Web tokens and sessions are both mechanisms used for storing and transmitting user information in web applications. However, there are some key differences between the two:

## Web Tokens

Web tokens are small pieces of data that are sent from the server to the client in the form of a token. The client can then send this token back to the server with each subsequent request to identify the user and verify their authenticity. Web tokens are typically stored in a client-side cookie or sent as an HTTP header.

## Sesssions

Sessions, on the other hand, are server-side constructs that are used to store user information and track a user's activity as they interact with a web application. When a user logs in to a web application, the server creates a session and assigns a unique session ID to the user. This session ID is then sent to the client as a cookie and is used to identify the user and track their activity as they navigate through the application.

## Conclusion

Overall, web tokens are generally considered to be a more secure and scalable solution for storing user information, as they are stored on the client-side and do not rely on the server to maintain state. However, sessions can be easier to implement and may be a suitable solution for smaller applications or those with simple authentication requirements.
