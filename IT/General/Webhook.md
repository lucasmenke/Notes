# Webhook

Webhooks are like APIs in reverse. With an API, you make requests to an API provider. Webhooks reverse this flow. Instead of you making a request to the API provider, the Webhook provider makes a request to you. Your code receives the request, then does something with it.

## Example

- Stripe sending you a notification about a new payment
