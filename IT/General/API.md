# API

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of commands, functions, protocols and objects that programmers can use to create software or interact with an external system.

API´s help to communicate with a database without knowing secret credentials. That means API´s can be used in client-sided application or websides. Client-sided applications recive the complete code so the code can´t contain passwords / credentials.

***Examples:***  library API´s (jQuery, Express, JavaScript) or data equests (weather forecast, financial data)

## Versions

- different versions help to not break code when significant changes are made to an existing API´s
