# Difference between Authentication and Authorization

In summary, authentication is about verifying identity, while authorization is about granting access to resources or actions based on that identity.

<br>

## Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying that someone is who they claim to be. This typically involves providing a username and password, and the system checking to see if the provided credentials are valid. If the credentials are valid, the user is authenticated.

## Authorization

Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to certain resources or actions based on the authenticated user's privileges or permissions. For example, an authenticated user might be authorized to read a file, but not authorized to modify it.
